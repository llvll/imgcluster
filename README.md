### Image clustering using the similarity algorithms: SIFT, SSIM, CW-SSIM, MSE

This project aims to implement the clustering of images by utilizing *Spectral Clustering* and *Affinity Propagation Clustering* together with a number of similarity algorithms, like: 

 * SIFT: Scale-invariant Feature Transform
 * SSIM: Structural Similarity Index
 * CW-SSIM: Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity Index
 * MSE: Mean Squared Error

The best clustering results are selected according to the calculated performance metrics for clustering:

 * Silhouette Coefficient
 * Completeness Score
 * Homogeneity Score

IPython Notebook (.ipynb file) is included for step-by-step execution of the demo application with extra comments.

The project is using *OpenCV 3.1*, *Scikit-Learn*, *Scikit-Image* and *PySSIM* for image manipulations, similarity measurements and clustering.
