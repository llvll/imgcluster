      A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are members of a
      given class are elements of the same cluster. Score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for
      perfectly complete labeling.
    * Homogeneity Score
      A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points,
      which are members of a single class. 1.0 stands for perfectly homogeneous labeling.
